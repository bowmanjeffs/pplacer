round
=====

`round` clusters the placements by rounding branch lengths.

::

  usage: round [options] placefile[s]

Options
=======

--out-dir  Specify the directory to write files to.
--prefix  Specify a string to be prepended to filenames.
--sig-figs  Set the number of significant figures used for rounding. Specify 0 for no rounding. Default: 3.
--cutoff  Set the rounding inclusion cutoff for the ML weight ratio. Default: 0.01.

Details
=======

This subcommand provides very basic "clustering" functionality.
This is not meant to derive "species level" or analogous groupings, but rather to group placements which will have essentially identical impact in a guppy analysis.

Rounding is done as follows:

  * throw out the placement mass below the ``--cutoff`` level
  * round the branch lengths to ``--sig-figs`` significant figures
  * group placements that are identical after this process.
